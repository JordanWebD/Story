This is a test file only.
I am Mac-Jordan D. Peralta, a spiring Full Stack Web Developer but I would like to have a deeper knowledge in executing backend development. More on typing and logics.
Let's see on what path I will be going.

For the frontend development, it is fun and creative. You get to design pages.
In my experience along the bootcamp, I was more obsessed on javascript.
After finishing the bootcamp, I will start to apply for works while learning more on javascript.

It is correct, javascript it the mostly used programming language because of the flexibility it has, from frontend development to backend development.

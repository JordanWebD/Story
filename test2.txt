This is my test2 file.
Let us try this file to check for changes made if can be logged and can be returned to the previous change once there is a messed up contents
on this file.

This seems to be effective in case there would be a need to return back to the previous revision.
Especially in case that the codes made were not working but some divisions of the file are working fine.
It would be better to totatlly discard all the recent changes rather than stocking myself on the same loop of problem which will eventuall consume so much of time.
It would be effective to create new codes since there was an error made already and experienced the potential problems that can be tested in a step by step approach when going back
to the previous revision.
